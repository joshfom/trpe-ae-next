# Enhanced Luxe Property Server Actions

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the luxe property server actions to support optimized image operations as part of the luxe properties image management feature.

## Enhanced Functions

### 1. `updateLuxePropertyAction`

**Enhancements:**
- **Selective Image Operations**: Now handles add/delete/reorder operations selectively instead of replacing all images
- **Atomic Database Transactions**: All image operations are wrapped in database transactions for data integrity
- **Image Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up deleted images from EdgeStore storage
- **Optimized Database Queries**: Minimizes database operations through batch processing and concurrent updates
- **Enhanced Validation**: Validates image operations before processing to prevent invalid states

**New Features:**
- Support for `imageOperations` parameter with structured operations:
  - `imagesToDelete`: Array of image IDs to remove
  - `newImages`: Array of new images to add
  - `orderUpdates`: Array of order changes for existing images
  - `existingImages`: Array of current images for reference
- Automatic storage cleanup for deleted images
- Batch processing for order updates
- Comprehensive error handling with rollback support

### 2. `deleteLuxePropertyAction`

**Enhancements:**
- **Storage Cleanup**: Automatically removes all property images from EdgeStore when deleting a property
- **Batch Deletion**: Processes image deletions in batches to avoid overwhelming the storage service
- **Error Resilience**: Continues with property deletion even if image cleanup fails

### 3. New Utility Functions

#### `batchUpdateImageOrders`
- Dedicated function for updating image orders in batch
- Validates that all images belong to the specified property
- Uses concurrent database operations for better performance

#### `getLuxePropertyWithImages`
- Retrieves property data along with associated images
- Optimized for editing scenarios where both property and image data are needed
- Includes proper error handling and data validation

#### `getPropertyImageStats`
- Provides statistics about property images
- Returns total image count and ordered image list
- Useful for analytics and debugging

#### `validateImageOperations`
- Validates image operations before database execution
- Checks image ownership, final image count constraints, and data integrity
- Prevents invalid operations that could leave the property in an inconsistent state

#### `cleanupDeletedImages`
- Handles batch deletion of images from EdgeStore
- Processes deletions in configurable batch sizes
- Includes retry logic and error handling for individual image failures

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Operations
1. **Batch Updates**: Order updates are processed concurrently using `Promise.all`
2. **Selective Operations**: Only processes actual changes instead of replacing all data
3. **Transaction Safety**: All operations are wrapped in database transactions
4. **Query Optimization**: Minimizes database round trips through efficient query patterns

### Storage Operations
1. **Batch Processing**: Image deletions are processed in batches of 5
2. **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple storage operations run concurrently where safe
3. **Error Isolation**: Individual image deletion failures don't affect other operations
4. **Rate Limiting**: Small delays between batches to respect storage service limits

### Memory Management
1. **Streaming Operations**: Large image operations are processed in chunks
2. **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses optimized data structures for image tracking
3. **Garbage Collection**: Properly cleans up temporary data structures

## Error Handling

### Database Errors
- **Transaction Rollback**: Automatic rollback on any database operation failure
- **Constraint Validation**: Validates foreign key constraints before operations
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Uses proper transaction ordering to prevent deadlocks

### Storage Errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Storage cleanup failures don't fail the main operation
- **Retry Logic**: Implements retry logic for transient storage failures
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging and monitoring

### Validation Errors
- **Pre-operation Validation**: Validates all operations before database changes
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Ensures image count constraints are maintained
- **User-friendly Messages**: Provides clear error messages for validation failures

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All functions require authenticated user sessions
- User permissions are validated before any operations

### Data Validation
- All input data is validated using Zod schemas
- Image URLs are validated for proper format and security
- File operations include security checks for malicious content

### Access Control
- Images can only be modified by authorized users
- Property ownership is validated before image operations
- Cross-property image operations are prevented

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Core Logic Testing**: Tests for image operation validation and processing
- **Error Handling**: Tests for various error scenarios and recovery
- **Performance Testing**: Tests for batch operation efficiency

### Integration Tests
- **Database Integration**: Tests for transaction safety and data integrity
- **Storage Integration**: Tests for image cleanup and storage operations
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests for complete image management workflows

## Usage Examples

### Basic Image Operations
```typescript
const result = await updateLuxePropertyAction(propertyId, {
  // ... property data
  imageOperations: {
    imagesToDelete: ['img-1', 'img-2'],
    newImages: [
      { file: 'https://storage.com/new-image.jpg', order: 0 }
    ],
    orderUpdates: [
      { id: 'img-3', order: 1 }
    ],
    existingImages: [
      { id: 'img-3', url: 'https://storage.com/existing.jpg', order: 1 }
    ]
  }
});
```

### Batch Order Updates
```typescript
const result = await batchUpdateImageOrders(propertyId, [
  { id: 'img-1', order: 0 },
  { id: 'img-2', order: 1 },
  { id: 'img-3', order: 2 }
]);
```

### Property with Images Retrieval
```typescript
const result = await getLuxePropertyWithImages(propertyId);
if (result.success) {
  const { property, images } = result.data;
  // Use property and images data
}
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- The enhanced functions maintain backward compatibility with existing `images` parameter
- Existing code will continue to work without modifications
- New `imageOperations` parameter is optional and takes precedence when provided

### Performance Impact
- Enhanced functions are more efficient for partial updates
- Reduced database load through selective operations
- Improved user experience through faster response times

### Storage Considerations
- Automatic cleanup reduces storage costs
- Batch operations reduce API call overhead
- Error handling prevents orphaned files

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image resizing and format conversion
2. **CDN Integration**: Direct CDN uploads for better performance
3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk property image operations
4. **Analytics**: Image usage analytics and optimization recommendations

### Performance Improvements
1. **Caching**: Image metadata caching for faster retrieval
2. **Lazy Loading**: Lazy loading for large image collections
3. **Compression**: Automatic image compression for storage efficiency
4. **Prefetching**: Intelligent image prefetching for better UX

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics to Monitor
- Image operation success rates
- Storage cleanup efficiency
- Database transaction performance
- Error rates and types

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular cleanup of orphaned images
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error log analysis and resolution
- Storage usage monitoring and optimization

## Conclusion

The enhanced luxe property server actions provide a robust, performant, and secure foundation for comprehensive image management. The implementation follows best practices for database operations, storage management, and error handling while maintaining backward compatibility and providing a clear upgrade path for future enhancements.
