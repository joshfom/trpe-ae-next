# Accessibility Contrast Fixes

## Issue
The application had several contrast accessibility issues where text colors didn't meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio). The primary issue was with `text-gray-400` (#9CA3AF) on light backgrounds like `bg-gray-50` (#F9FAFB).

## Root Cause
The color `text-gray-400` has insufficient contrast ratio when used on light backgrounds:
- `text-gray-400` (#9CA3AF) on `bg-gray-50` (#F9FAFB): **2.8:1 ratio** ❌ (needs 4.5:1)
- `text-gray-400` (#9CA3AF) on white (#FFFFFF): **2.9:1 ratio** ❌ (needs 4.5:1)

## Solutions Applied
Replaced `text-gray-400` with `text-gray-500` or `text-gray-600` for better contrast:
- `text-gray-500` (#6B7280) on `bg-gray-50`: **4.6:1 ratio** ✅
- `text-gray-600` (#4B5563) on white: **7.0:1 ratio** ✅

- ✅ Better readability for users with visual impairments
- ✅ Improved user experience across all devices
- ✅ Better SEO scores due to accessibility improvements
- ✅ Legal compliance with accessibility standards

## Testing
Test these changes with:
1. **Browser DevTools**: Use Lighthouse accessibility audit
2. **Online Tools**: WebAIM Contrast Checker
3. **Real Users**: Test with users who have visual impairments
4. **Automated Testing**: Include contrast checks in CI/CD pipeline

## Future Prevention
Consider adding ESLint rules or automated testing to catch contrast issues during development:
```javascript
// Example rule to flag potentially problematic color combinations
'no-low-contrast-colors': ['error', {
  'text-gray-400': ['bg-white', 'bg-gray-50', 'bg-gray-100']
}]
```
