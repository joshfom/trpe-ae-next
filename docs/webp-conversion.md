# WebP Image Conversion Implementation

## Overview
This implementation automatically converts all uploaded images to WebP format across the entire application. WebP provides better compression than JPEG and PNG while maintaining high quality, resulting in faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage.

## Components Updated

### Core Utilities
- **`/lib/image-utils.ts`** - Core image conversion utilities
- **`/hooks/use-image-upload.ts`** - Centralized hook for image uploads with WebP conversion

### TipTap Editor
- **`/components/TiptapEditor.tsx`** - Updated to convert images on:
  - Drag & drop
  - Paste from clipboard
  - Manual upload via image button

### Dropzone Components
- **`/components/single-image-dropzone.tsx`** - Single image uploads
- **`/components/multi-image-dropzone.tsx`** - Multiple image uploads  
- **`/components/ui/multi-file-dropzone.tsx`** - UI component for multiple files

### Admin Components
- **`/features/community/components/EditCommunitySheet.tsx`** - Community avatar uploads
- **`/features/admin/luxe/properties/components/LuxePropertyForm.tsx`** - Property image galleries
- **`/features/admin/off_plans/components/AdminOffplanGallery.tsx`** - Off-plan image galleries

## How It Works

### 1. Image Conversion Process
```typescript
// Automatic conversion with optimized settings
const { quality, maxWidth, maxHeight } = getOptimizedImageSettings(file)
const webpFile = await convertImageToWebP(file, quality, maxWidth, maxHeight)
```

### 2. Quality and Size Optimization
- **Large files (>5MB)**: 70% quality, max 1920x1080
- **Medium files (2-5MB)**: 80% quality, max 2560x1440  
- **Small files (<2MB)**: 85% quality, no size limit

### 3. Fallback Handling
If WebP conversion fails, the system gracefully falls back to the original file format.

## Usage Examples

### Using the Hook
```typescript
import { useImageUpload } from '@/hooks/use-image-upload'

function MyComponent() {
  const { uploadSingleImage, convertToWebP } = useImageUpload()
  
  const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
    try {
      const url = await uploadSingleImage(file)
      // url points to converted WebP file
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Upload failed:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

### Direct Conversion
```typescript
import { convertImageToWebP } from '@/lib/image-utils'

const webpFile = await convertImageToWebP(originalFile, 0.8, 1920, 1080)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced File Sizes**: WebP typically reduces file sizes by 25-50% compared to JPEG/PNG
2. **Faster Loading**: Smaller files mean faster page loads and better user experience
3. **Bandwidth Savings**: Reduced data usage for users and lower hosting costs
4. **SEO Benefits**: Faster loading images contribute to better Core Web Vitals scores
5. **Automatic**: No manual intervention required - conversion happens transparently

## Browser Support
WebP is supported by all modern browsers (95%+ coverage). The conversion happens client-side, so older browsers that don't support WebP creation will fall back to original formats.

## Future Enhancements

1. **AVIF Support**: Add support for the even more efficient AVIF format
2. **Progressive Loading**: Implement progressive image loading with blur placeholders
3. **Batch Processing**: Optimize multiple image conversion for better performance
4. **Server-side Conversion**: Add server-side conversion as a fallback option

## Monitoring

Monitor the effectiveness of WebP conversion by tracking:
- Average file size reduction
- Page load time improvements
- User engagement metrics
- Core Web Vitals scores

The implementation is designed to be transparent to users while providing significant performance benefits across the entire application.
