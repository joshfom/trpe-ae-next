                                Appointing the right property consultant is a very important first step. Everything else becomes
                                very easy because a good property consultant will do everything else for you. From pricing to
                                photography and video shoots of your property, listing, advertising and finding prospective buyers â€“
                                they will handle the entire process for you.

                                The process for formally appointing a property consultant is to sign a Form A. This is Dubai Land
                                Department&apos;s (DLD) official contract between a seller and a real estate agent. It contains the
                                details of both parties and the financial arrangement (i.e. the agreed commission amount) between
                                them.

                                To sign the Form A, you will need to provide the property consultant with a copy of your passport,
                                visa page, Emirates ID and title deed (or Oqood, if your property is off-plan).

                                Apart from that, make sure you have the following set of documents ready, because you will need them
                                at the Dubai Land Department Trustee office when you transfer the property:
                            </p>

                                In addition to that, if you have done any modifications or renovations to the original property as
                                you had bought it, then you should have documents pertaining to obtaining permits and approvals for
                                the same.

                                Needless to say, you should make sure the property is in good condition for viewing by prospective
                                buyers, and for any photography or videography that the property consultant will want to do in order
                                to list your property.

                                is held by the property consultant; and is not handed over to either party.

                                You will now need to apply for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the property developer. This
                                usually costs between AED 500 to AED 5000. Usually, both parties will go to the developer&apos;s
                                office to apply for this document. However, in some cases, this can also be done online.
                            </p>

                                An important point to note is that if your property is mortgaged, you will need to get a liability
                                letter from the lending bank. This document is usually valid for a period of 15 days. You can only
                                get an NOC after you have obtained the liability letter.

                                The buyer must first settle this mortgage. It will be done at the DLD Trustee office, where the
                                Trustee office will hold the buyer&apos;s payments and issue a &quot;Restrain Property&quot; certificate. You will
                                receive a clearance letter from your lending bank.

                                accompanied by the property consultant (and also the mortgage broker of the lending bank if the
                                buyer is using a mortgage to buy the property). You will need to take all your original documents
                                with you, which you should already have ready since you have addressed this earlier on in the
                                process.
