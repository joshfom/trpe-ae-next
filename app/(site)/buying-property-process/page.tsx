                                It&apos;s tempting to start looking for properties before anything else. Of course, it helps to know
                                what&apos;s out there and what it costs. But the first thing you should do is to understand what your
                                financial resources are like, how much you can put aside towards property purchase and how much you
                                would need as your safety net.
                            </p>

                                Based on that, you decide whether or not you want to pay for your property in cash or opt for a home loan. In the latter case, it is always advisable to appoint a qualified mortgage broker. They can help you find the most suitable home finance deals.

                                Your budget is likely to influence this decision. You will need to factor in up-front costs such as

                                If you are keen on moving into a new home as soon as possible or to invest in a property for quicker
                                rental returns, you should only explore properties that are ready to move in; possibly already
                                tenanted.

                                If you are considering a move in the longer term or planning on capital gains, exploring off-plan
                                properties is the way to go. This will allow you to benefit from current promotions, lower prices
                                and developers&apos; payment plans.

                            <p>
                                If you are buying for investment instead of personal use, then consider locations that are in high demand in the rental market. We recommend appointing a qualified property consultant. They will be able to guide you and save you the time you would have spent in doing this research.

                                Now is the most suitable time to look for properties. You will now have a good idea of the price range you want to look in, when you would like to take possession and the kind of locations you would prefer. Based on these, you will find properties ranging from cosy studio apartments to family townhouses and spacious luxury villas.

While property portals will give you a wide selection to choose from, a property consultant will be able to save you a lot of time by narrowing down your search to only show you properties that meet your requirements.
